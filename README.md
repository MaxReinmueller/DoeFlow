# DoeFlow

Doeflow is a tool that helps people visualize their current financial situation, "what if I???" situation and achieve their goals.

## How it works

* Set a goal
* Input your estimated income and expenses to get a estimate of how much money is left over every month.
* Use the situation tool to see what you need to do to achieve it.

## How it works
### how much do you have?
#### Living money 
DoeFlow subtracts "Bills that are the same every month from your monthly income to give you your "living money".
#### Whats left
"Expenses that vary" are subtracted from your "living money" to give you "money for goals".
#### Money for Goals
The money left over is the money you can use to achieve your goals.
