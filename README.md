# DoeFlow

Doeflow is a tool that helps people visualize their current financial situation, "what if I???" situation and achieve their goals.

## How it works

* Set a goal
* Input your estimated income and expenses to get a estimate of how much money is left over everymonth.
* Use the situation tool to see what you need to do to achieve your goals such as moving.

### Basic financial information

* What is your goal
* is it monthly income goal or a specific amount of savings?
* How much money do you think you need to achieve it

#### Income
* Your hourly wage or monthly salary
* Number of hours worked per month

#### Bills that are the same every month
* Rent payment
* internet and utilities
* Car payment
* Car insurance
* Phone
* Health insurance
* CC payment
* any other month

#### Expenses that vary
* Food
* Gas
* Entainerment
* IDK but I spent it on something

#### Your thoughts
* how much money do you think is left over every month?
* if not why?
