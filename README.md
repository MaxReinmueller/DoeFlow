# DoeFlow

Doeflow is a tool that helps people visualize their current financial situation, "what if I???" situation and achieve their goals.

## How it works

* Set a goal
* Input your estimated income and expenses to get a estimate of how much money is left over every month.
* Use the situation tool to see what you need to do to achieve it.

## How it works
### how much do you have?
1. Living money (money left after bills)
  1. DoeFlow subtracts "Bills that are the same every month from your monthly income to give you your "living money".
1. Whats left (money left after expenses that vary)
  1. "Expenses that vary" are subtracted from your "living money" to give you "money for goals".
1. Money for Goals (money you can use for goals)

### what if i?
1. adjust with the hours you work, hourly wage, how changing what you do can change your life.
